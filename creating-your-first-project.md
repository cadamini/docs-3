# Creating your first project

### Create an Organizaiton

In order to get started tracking your webpack build stats, you need to create an organization to house your team and projects.  Anyone invited to your organization will be able to see and interact with any projects created by your organization.

### Create your project

Once you have an organization set up, you are ready to create your first project.  Projects provide you a space to visualize your webpack asset history allowing you to keep track of the assets you are delivering to your users.  Once you have created your project you will have access to the `project_token` on your project settings page. This token is what identifies your project when uploading to packtracker.
