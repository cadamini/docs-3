# Managing your team

Inviting members to your organization

Once you have created your organization, you can access your team management feature through the **People** tab on your organization overview page.  On this page you will be able to see existing members, see outstanding invitations, and send out new invitations.

When inviting a team member \(and managing existing members\), we have 3 levels of access for you to choose from.
